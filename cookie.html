            <p>Last Updated: May 25, 2021</p>

            <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
            <p>
              This Cookies Policy describes how Arka Energy, Inc. (“we” or “us” or “our”) uses cookies and similar
              technologies to
              recognize you when you visit our website at https://www.arka.energy (the “Site”). It explains what cookies
              are, why we
              use them, how third-parties we partner with may use cookies on the Site, your choices regarding cookies,
              and further
              information about cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may update this Cookies Policy from time to time in order to reflect changes to the cookies we use or
              for other
              operational, legal or regulatory reasons. You are encouraged to periodically review this Cookies Policy to
              stay informed
              about our use of cookies and related technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The date at the top of this Cookies Policy indicates when it was last updated.
            </p>
            <p><b>
                WHAT ARE COOKIES
              </b></p>
            <p>
              A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile
              device. The
              cookie allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over time. Cookies are widely used by
              website owners
              in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting
              information. Most
              browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete them whenever
              they like.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies that are stored by the Site directly are called “first party cookies”. They allow us to collect
              analytics data,
              remember language settings, and perform other useful functions that provide you with a good user
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies that are created by websites other than our Site are called “third party cookies”. Third party
              cookies are used
              for cross-site tracking, retargeting and ad-serving. The parties that set these third party cookies can
              recognize your
              computer both when you visit our Site and also when you visit certain other websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies can be “session” cookies (temporary cookie files that are erased when you close your browser) or
              “persistent”
              cookies (cookies that stay on one of your browser’s subfolders until you delete them manually or your
              browser deletes
              them based on the duration period contained within the persistent cookie’s file).
            </p>
            <p><b>
                HOW WE USE COOKIES
              </b></p>
            <p>
              When you use and access the Site, a number of cookies files may be placed in your web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons
              in order for
              our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as “Required” cookies. Other cookies enable us to enhance
              the performance
              and functionality of our Site and provide for a better online experience, but are not otherwise essential
              for use of the
              Site. Still other cookies, including third party cookies are used for advertising, analytics,
              customization, and other
              purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Examples of the principal first and third party cookies served through our Site and the purposes they
              perform are
              described below:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Required cookies:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Site and to use
              some of its
              features, such as access to secure areas. For example, we may use essential cookies to authenticate users
              and prevent
              fraudulent use of user accounts.
            </p>
            <p><b>Functional cookies:</b></p>
            <p>
              These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Site but are otherwise
              non-essential to its
              use. Certain functional cookies may enable the Site to remember how far you are through an order, remember
              your log-in
              details, remember what is in your shopping cart, and ensure the consistent appearance of the Site. Some of
              the main
              functional cookies on our Site include [WordPress, WooCommerce, ShipStation, Vimeo, Klaviyo, Privy,
              Loqate, Stripe,
              Paypal, Alvlara, and Zendesk]. If you choose to block these cookies, our Site may not work as it should
              and any
              preferences you have may be lost.
            </p>
            <p><b>Analytics and customization cookies:</b></p>
            <p>
              These cookies (principally, Google Analytics, Google Maps API, HubSpot API, and Tag Manager) collect
              information that is
              used to help us understand how our Site is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to
              help us
              customize our Site experience for you.
            </p>
            <p><b>Advertising cookies:</b></p>
            <p>
              These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They may perform various
              functions such as
              preventing repetitious ads, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases
              selecting
              advertisements that are geared to your interests. These cookies are used by advertising companies to serve
              ads that are
              relevant to your interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, third parties (including Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Google, and LinkedIn) may serve
              cookies on your
              computer or mobile device to deliver targeted advertising through our Site. These companies may use
              information about
              your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about products and
              services in which
              you may have an interest. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
              their
              advertisements. This can be accomplished through the use of cookies or web beacons to collect information
              about your
              visits to our Site and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about products and
              services of
              potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to
              identify your
              name, contact details or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
            </p>
            <p><b>OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies are not the only way we recognize or track visitors to our Site. We may use other, similar
              technologies from
              time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny
              graphics files that
              contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site or opened an
              e-mail containing
              a link to our Site. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
              within our Site
              to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the Site
              directly or from an
              online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the
              success of
              e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
              properly, and so
              declining cookies will impair their functioning.
            </p>
            <p><b>
                WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES REGARDING COOKIES
              </b></p>
            <p>
              You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your rights by setting
              or amending
              your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can delete or refuse to
              accept cookies
              through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu
              for more
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you delete cookies or refuse to accept them, you may still use our Site; however you might not be able
              to use all of
              the features we offer or be able to store your preferences, and some of our pages might not display
              properly. Please
              note that required cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to use the Site.
            </p>
